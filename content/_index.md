## DevOps Course Project Of HeikkiR

Hello! My name is Heikki Rantala. I am a Computer Science doctoral candidate at Aalto University. I work at the Semantic Computing Research Group SeCo. My thesis deals with disseminating and analyzing cultural heritage data. Generally my research interests include Linked Open Data, Digital Humanities, History, Archaeology, and Cultural Heritage in general. I wish that the Covid pandemic would end already so that I could go to some conferences in Cyprus, or Athens or similar places. As a hobby I like to read popular history, and I do dancing, from swing dancing, to folk dances and Finnish ballroom dancing. I also do martial arts
